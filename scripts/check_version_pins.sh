# The repo states its pinned versions in several places — the Dockerfile ARG the
# image builds from, the run_local.sh default a contributor builds from, and the
# README / DEPLOY prose a reader believes. They have to agree, and nothing made
# them.
#
# In the sibling cw-playground repo they did not: `run_local.sh` sat at cljw
# v1.0.0 through BOTH the v1.6.0 and the v1.7.0 bumps — five releases of drift —
# because a bump was a manual sweep, and a manual sweep is exactly as complete
# as the person's memory. Someone running the demo locally then built a cljw
# from a different era than the deployed one, which is the worst kind of
# difference: it makes a local reproduction of a production bug unreliable
# without saying so. This repo tracked correctly by luck, not by mechanism.
#
# Classification is per OCCURRENCE, not per line. The first version of this
# script skipped any LINE mentioning zwasm — and `DEPLOY.md:4` names both
# versions on one line, so neither was rewritten AND the check did not look at
# it. A false green, in the script written to prevent false greens.
#
# `vX.Y.Z+` is a FLOOR ("since vX.Y.Z"), a capability statement that stays true
# as the pin moves. Excluded; the trailing `+` is the marker, visible in the
# prose rather than listed here.
